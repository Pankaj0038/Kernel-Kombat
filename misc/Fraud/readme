----------------- Fraud ------------------300

Spider likes to play dice games. He threw five dice and noted down the results. He repeated this process five times. I saw his notes as "2352511655533513166113621". When I asked him what he was doing, Spider said, 'I have found something new' Well, the old one is 'jeclat2024ison' but I forget where he used this password!
